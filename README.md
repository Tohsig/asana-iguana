# AsanaIguana - Points counter for Asana
This is a simple webapp that speeds up the process of tracking an Agile-style points system in Asana. I threw together the initial version over the course of a few days. Currently all it does is tally points-per-person (based off of tasks with number tags) for any given date range. If there's interest, I'd like to expand it further.
